# AI-Based-Diagnostic-Application
The AI-Based Diagnostic Application is a Java-based system designed to assist in diagnosing household appliance malfunctions, specifically focusing on the Bosch Series 8 ProSilence BGS7MS64 vacuum cleaner and a selected washing machine. The application incorporates both inductive and deductive reasoning to enhance fault detection accuracy. Using the C4.5 decision tree algorithm, the inductive reasoning approach analyzes historical fault data to predict possible failures based on given symptoms. Meanwhile, the rule-based system applies deductive reasoning by following predefined expert rules to identify appliance issues. The system features an intuitive user interface (UI) that allows users to input symptoms, retrieve diagnostic results, and compare the two reasoning approaches. Additionally, the project emphasizes sustainability and cost efficiency by helping users make informed repair or replacement decisions. The AI-powered approach ensures a structured, data-driven method for troubleshooting, improving repair efficiency, and reducing unnecessary maintenance costs.
